# 3D-Graphics
This project was part of an advanced rogramming course where partial code was provided and we were tasked to finish the code

This program draws a 6 sided cube and allows the user to rotate it as well as zoom in and out.

# Drawing the cube
We were code that had drawn the front face of the cube and the gradient on it. I made the code to add the other five faces as well as the gradient the the marges with the front of the cube.

# Rotating the cube
The starter code only allowed for the cube to be rotated in one direction. I added code to allow it to be rotated in both directions on the y-axis and the other x-axis.

# Moving the camera
Added code to allow the zooming in and out of the camera with the keys (g) and (s).
